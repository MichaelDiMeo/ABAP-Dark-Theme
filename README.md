# ABAP Dark theme
This is a dark theme for ABAP (NetWeaver), inspired on the Apple Human Interface Guidelines color scheme.

# Install
Go to this folder in your machine to find the theme files:

`%APPDATA%\SAP\SAP GUI\ABAP Editor\`

It's recommended at this point that you create a backup of your original files. Replace the abap_spec.xml file with the template of your choice. 
Restart SAP Gui and your ABAP editor will now use the new theme. One last tip for you is that you can change your font as well, I am using Consolas.
